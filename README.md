# GoXLRVolume
A simple executable to set volume for the various GoXLR virtual devices

Primarily threw this together so that I could set device volumes through my Stream Deck, and decided to make it public

NOTE: This changes the volume of the device through Windows Mixer -- the result, unfortunately, will not be seen on the physical mixer or within the GoXLR app. :(

To download a published version, go here:

Usage:
`goxlrvolume <device> <volume %>`

Example:
`goxlrvolume music 50`
